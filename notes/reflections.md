# Reflections for the next class

* Consider trying to start each day with exercises rather than homework review?
* Consider whether git should be taught so early?
* All four assignments in week 1 should be code assignments.  Don't do instructions or make-objects.
* Change all assignments (except the first one) to say that submissions should be done by pull requests.
* Beef up My First Git Repo example
* Add Battleship tests to make it less possible to complete all the tests and have a working game.
* Write up note at the end of week 2 as an exercise
