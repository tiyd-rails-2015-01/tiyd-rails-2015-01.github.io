# Reflections for the next class

* Consider trying to start each day with exercises rather than homework review?
* Consider whether git should be taught so early?
* All four assignments in week 1 should be code assignments.  Don't do instructions or make-objects.
* Change all assignments (except the first one) to say that submissions should be done by pull requests. OR MAYBE DON'T.  They don't get github credit.
* Beef up My First Git Repo example
* Add Battleship tests to make it less possible to complete all the tests and have a working game.
* Write up note at the end of week 2 as an exercise
* Clean up assignment formatting - **merge requirements and normal mode**.  **merge the two kinds of objectives**.  Get consistent about deliverables (maybe unbold) and notes/additional resources.
* Give all assignments better (simpler) names.
* The students have requested more days of build-a-whole-app.
* Use Foundation instead of Bourbon
* Readings at night were largely ignored.  Probably better to have smaller sets of reading.
* Git immersion stunk.  Pro Git better?
* Update assignment JSONs as we work through cohort 4.
* Write an Address Book assignment to follow Address Book Data Structure (and beef up requirements of ABDS a bit)


Rails approach for next time:

* W3D2: Rails new (structure on board), HTML forms, GET and POST, params, rails-footnotes gem.
* Motivation
* W3D3: Database, migrations, models. Make a database table for Quotations. Scaffold (comment out `jbuilder` gem).
* Wallet
* W3D4: Validations, Relations, .count, .sum, etc.  Heroku.  
* WEEKEND: Health Tracker
* W4D1: Scaffold deep-dive, has_many/belongs_to, .order, .where, etc.
* Wallet Prime
* W4D2: SCSS, Foundation, using console to set data, seeds
* Menu
* W4D3: Session, Access/Auth/Auth.  Give them a checklist of how to get the assignment done.
* Teacherbook
* W4D4: Review and rebuild it all together.
* WEEKEND: Gradebook
