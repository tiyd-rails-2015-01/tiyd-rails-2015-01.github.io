## Accounts You'll need

As soon as possible after receiving your Mac, run through the following steps.
If you've done a lot of your own configuration, some of these steps may have to
change.  If you run into ANY PROBLEMS, send me an e-mail at:

mason.matthews@theironyard.com

Again, we want to have all of these kinks worked out in advance, so PLEASE
e-mail if things don't work as described below.
