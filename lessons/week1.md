## Wednesday

#### Lecture

* Homework review
* Object Oriented Programming
  * What are objects?
    * State and behavior
    * State = instance variables
    * Behavior = methods
    * Tell, don't ask
  * What are classes?
    * Blueprints for objects
* Example: [Albums and Artists](https://github.com/masonfmatthews/rails_assignments/tree/master/exercises/albums_and_artists)
* Exercise: [Employees and Departments](https://github.com/masonfmatthews/rails_assignments/tree/master/exercises/employees_and_departments)
* Surprise: everything in Ruby is an object!
  * All functions are actually methods on classes
* Object Oriented Programming
  * Inheritance
* Exploration: Start with Float object.  Explore superclasses and classes.

#### Reading

* Start [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/).  Work through `about_symbols.rb`.

#### Assignment

* [Battleship Objects](https://github.com/masonfmatthews/rails_assignments/tree/master/assignments/battleship_objects)

## Thursday

#### Lecture

* Homework review and Koans check-in
* More on inheritance.  Examples.
* Exercise: [National Expressions](https://github.com/masonfmatthews/rails_assignments/tree/master/exercises/national_expressions)
