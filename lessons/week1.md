  <!-- My job is to keep you at the outer edge of the Learning Zone -->
  * Feedback Cycles
  <!-- They're important in life. The shorter and more frequent they are, the better. -->
  <!-- You'll be giving the TA daily reports on where you are in the zones. -->
  <!-- 1-6 for lecture, 1-6 for assignment, # of hours for assignment. -->
* Diagram: Three Concentric Zones
* Daily schedule
* Types of assignments
* Ruby History?
* Instructions - PB & J
* Control Flow
  * PB & J for the entire class.  Use a while, maybe an if.
  * if/else
  * while loop
  * indentation
* Variable Assignment
  * PB & J for the entire class, everyone wants a different jelly.
  * strings
  * integers
  * other numbers
  * dates
  * date/times
* Markdown

#### Notes

* [Notebook Transcript](w1-1/w1m.html)

#### Assignment

* [Number Guessing Game](https://github.com/tiyd-rails-2015-01/number_guessing)

## Wednesday

#### Lecture

* Homework review
  * Talk about next, break, return, and exit
  * [Not entering your password into git for every push](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/)
* More on previous topics:
  * Talk about Ranges and how they were used in the assignment
  * Array Example: Keeping track of all the names in class
  * Use a .each, then a .map
  * To prevent duplicates, use a Set.
  * To keep track of things like first names and last names, use an array of hashes
  * Do a .each, then a .map on a hash
* Break
* Object Oriented Programming
  * What are objects?
    * State and behavior
    * State = instance variables
    * Behavior = methods
    * Tell, don't ask
  * What are classes?
    * Blueprints for objects
* Example: [Albums and Artists](https://github.com/masonfmatthews/rails_assignments/tree/master/exercises/albums_and_artists)
  * Demonstrate how to put two classes in two different files.
* Exercise: [Employees and Departments](https://github.com/masonfmatthews/rails_assignments/tree/master/exercises/employees_and_departments)
* Surprise: everything in Ruby is an object!
  * All functions are actually methods on classes
* Object Oriented Programming
  * Inheritance
* Exploration: Start with Float object.  Explore superclasses and classes.
* Primer on Koans

#### Notes

* [Screenshot of 3 Classes](w1-3/screenshot.png)
