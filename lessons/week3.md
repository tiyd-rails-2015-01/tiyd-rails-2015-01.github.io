#### Lecture

* Project Review
  * Keyword arguments
  * Mocking tests
  * ||=
  * The OTHER of the 2 hardest problems in computer science: Cache invalidation
  * `File.open`
  * Floating point arithmetic
    * 129.95*10
    * 129.95*100
  * Params in URLs
  * " vs '
  * Don't overdo it on instance variables
  * Regular expressions
    * "Peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers"
    * +, *, ?
    * \w, \d, \s, and their capital (opposite) versions
* Exercise: Build the simplest possible version of function that tells you whether an e-mail address is valid.  Then, if you have time, make it better.
* More regex
  * Capture groups
  * Using regex in Ruby
  * .match
  * .scan, .sub, .gsub
* Human Learning: agile development practices
  * Iterate (this gets back to feedback cycles).
  * Build fully-functional apps during each iteration.
  * Example: Build an ecommerce site for T-shirts.  You know you want it to:
    * Accept credit card payments from customers
    * Allow orders to be made for specific size and color of shirts
    * Allow color/size combos to be marked as out-of-stock
    * Send sale e-mails
  * Pair programming (this gets back to feedback cycles)
* Diagram: Feedback cycles of escalating size
* Monkey Patching: Change a string to add a .to_pig_latin
