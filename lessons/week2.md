## Tuesday

#### Lecture

* Project Review
  * Good commit messages
  * [Not entering your password into git for every push](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/)
  * Removing incorrectly forked git repo
  * Show how easy refactoring is with good tests.  Perhaps turn a loop into a .any? or .all?
* Human Learning: agile development practices
  * Iterate (this gets back to feedback cycles).
  * Build fully-functional apps during each iteration.
  * Example: Build an ecommerce site for T-shirts.  You know you want it to:
    * Accept credit card payments from customers
    * Allow orders to be made for specific size and color of shirts
    * Allow color/size combos to be marked as out-of-stock
    * Send sale e-mails
  * Pair programming (this gets back to feedback cycles)
* Diagram: Feedback cycles of escalating size
* Enumerable methods:
  * .each
  * .map
  * .select / .reject
  * .all? / .any?
  * .reduce
  * Do a .each, then a .map on a hash
* Inline blocks (e.g. `array.map {|a| a.class }`)
* Parameter passing without parentheses
* Returning objects when true/false is expected
* Methods ending in !
* (Break)
* Exercise: ??? [Celebrity Couple Names](https://github.com/masonfmatthews/rails_assignments/tree/master/exercises/celebrity_couple_names)
* OO
  * Composition
  * Roles via modules
  * public vs private
* Other uses of modules
