#### Assignment

Your goal today is to reproduce two things that you might find on the web.

The first is a (terribly ugly) webpage containing one of Shakespeare's sonnets.

Here is the sonnet in text form: http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174354

Your goal is to make a webpage in JSFiddle that looks exactly like this: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Cssthingy.gif

Your work will probably proceed like this:
* Set up an account with JSFiddle.net.  Don't worry about registration fields you'd rather not enter.  Just leave them blank.
* You should be taken directly to a blank fiddle, but if you aren't, you can always type "jsfiddle.net" directly into your website to be given a new fiddle.
* Whenever you change your HTML or CSS, you'll have to hit the "Run" button to see your changes.
* The first time you save, the button will be called "Save."  Every time after that, it will be called "Update." Regardless of its name, make sure to hit it often.  The "Run" button does NOT save by itself.
* When you are finished, MAKE SURE TO HIT UPDATE, then hit the "Share" button, then copy and paste the first link into Basecamp as your completed assignment.

The second is the following button: TODO
