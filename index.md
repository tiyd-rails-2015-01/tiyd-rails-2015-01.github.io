## Welcome!

Welcome to the The Iron Yard in Durham!  Congratulations on being accepted, and for deciding to take on such an intense program.  The next three months will be exciting, exhausting, and empowering.  I hope you're looking forward to it as much as I am.

You're probably wondering what you're in for (or are at least wondering something about me), and while I can't answer all of your questions in this format, it's worth knowing that the class will be taking the following perspectives:

* Immersion is the best way to learn.
* Both lectures and projects have value.
* It's best to truly understand the fundamentals.
* Each new concept should expand your boundaries.
* We should form real-world coding habits as soon as possible.
* Agile, iterative development should be taught early on.
* Feedback is critical.

I've got more to say on each of these, and if you'd like to know WHY these things mater, [click here](/syllabus/values.html).

The remainder of this site gets down to brass tacks.  Here you'll find references and resources for you to use before, during, and after the class.
