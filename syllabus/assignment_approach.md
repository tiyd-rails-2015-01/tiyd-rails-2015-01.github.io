## Assignments and How They Work

* Mini-tasks
  * Halfway through lecture
  * Perhaps correlated with breaks?  Pros and cons
  * Accompanied by pre-written test suite where possible
  * Sometimes this will be practice, sometimes brain teasers
  * Students will likely not finish, and will have to get used to getting cut off
* Daily Assignments
  * Always as individuals
  * Always TDD
* Weekly Assignments
  * Always in pairs
  * Setting pairs can be tricky: need close skill level, varying skill set
  * Occasionally in pairs/groups across classes
  * Always TDD
